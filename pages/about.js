          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p className={style.mission}>
            The Course Reactor Foundation exists to democratize education and
            allow people from all walks of life to pursue their interests and
            participate in academia without economic or social barriers.
          </p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <ol className={style.list}>
            <li>Foster a community of well-grounded, lifelong learners.</li>
            <li>
              Provide free learning materials across a variety of subjects
              accessible to people of all abilities and learning styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              To faithfully address the underrepresentation of BIPOC (Black,
              Indigenous, and People of Colour) in professional communities.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The goals of The Course Reactor Foundation are foundationally rooted
            in addressing social and economic inequalities that have primarily
            manifested themselves in the exclusion of certain minority groups
            through a collaboration of policy and social barriers. While Course
            Reactor exists primarily to address these issues, we more broadly
            believe in the liberation of education and academia for all people
            and through our programs, hope to provide equitable pathways for
            anyone who wishes to pursue them.
          </p>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that education is a fundamental human right. The goals of
            Course Reactor are to provide a curriculum that is relevant,
            historically accurate, and democratically accepted amongst the
            appropriate bodies that govern over that subject matter. While we
            wish to provide education materials that span broadly amongst these
            topics, we hope to tailor our programs towards career readiness and
            providing skills that can be useful in progressing innovation.
          </p>
          <h3>Career Rediness</h3>
          <p>
            While the primary function of Course Reactor is not to explicitly
            place candidates in jobs or to act as a staffing or recruitment
            agency, we wish to provide quality and reputable resources to make
            students and prospective job candidatesâ€™ transition into these lines
            of work easier. We can achieve this through strategic partnerships
            with industry professionals and by providing a curriculum that
            advances skills while having a direct community impact.
          </p>
          <h3>Community Outreach</h3>
          <p>
            The Course Reactor Foundation is committed to remaining focused on
            positively impacting communities who find themselves disadvantaged
            for any number of reasons. Our courses are tailored towards
            providing students a chance to work on projects that demonstrate
            their skills while also providing valuable tools to the community.
